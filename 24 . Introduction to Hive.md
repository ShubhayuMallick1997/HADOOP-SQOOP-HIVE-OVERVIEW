# 24 . **Introduction to Hive**

**Apache Hive** is a data warehousing and SQL-like query language layer built on top of **Hadoop**. It facilitates the querying and analysis of large datasets stored in Hadoop's **HDFS** (Hadoop Distributed File System) and compatible file systems using a language called **Hive Query Language (HQL)**, which is similar to SQL. Hive is designed to provide an interface for batch processing large datasets, making it easier to analyze big data using simple SQL-like queries.

Hive was originally developed by Facebook to enable analysts to process large-scale data on Hadoop using SQL-like queries, which makes it easier for non-programmers to query and analyze big data.

## **What is Hive?**

Hive is a **data warehouse infrastructure** built on top of Hadoop. It provides a high-level interface for querying and managing structured data in **HDFS**. Hive abstracts the complexity of MapReduce, allowing users to focus on writing SQL-like queries to process large datasets.

Hive can store data in various file formats such as **Text**, **ORC**, **Parquet**, and **Avro**, and provides functionalities like partitioning, indexing, and user-defined functions (UDFs) to optimize query performance.

## **Key Features of Hive**:

* **SQL-like Language**: Hive provides a language called **Hive Query Language (HQL)**, which is similar to SQL. This allows analysts and developers to interact with big data without needing to learn complex MapReduce programming.
* **Extensibility**: Users can define their own custom functions, including **User Defined Functions (UDFs)**, **User Defined Aggregation Functions (UDAFs)**, and **User Defined Table Functions (UDTFs)** to extend Hive’s capabilities.
* **Schema on Read**: Hive allows you to define the schema for your data during query time, i.e., the data is not required to be stored in a predefined schema (unlike traditional RDBMS).
* **Scalability**: Hive scales to handle large datasets by leveraging Hadoop’s distributed computing model.

## **Hive Architecture and Components**

Hive follows a **client-server** architecture. The key components of Hive architecture include:

## **1. Hive Clients**

* **Hive CLI**: Command-line interface for interacting with Hive.
* **Hive Web UI**: A graphical user interface for interacting with Hive through a web browser.
* **JDBC/ODBC Drivers**: These allow applications to connect to Hive using standard database connectivity protocols.

## **2. Hive Driver**

* The **Hive Driver** is responsible for managing the lifecycle of the queries. It receives a query from the user and processes it by compiling, planning, and executing it. It acts as an interface between the client and other components.

## **3. Hive Compiler**

* The **Hive Compiler** parses the HiveQL query, converts it into a **logical plan**, and then generates an **execution plan** for the query.
* The logical plan is a high-level representation of the query, and the execution plan specifies how to execute the query using Hadoop’s **MapReduce** or other execution engines.

## **4. Hive Metastore**

* The **Metastore** stores metadata information about tables, partitions, and the schema of the datasets. It is a central repository that Hive uses to retrieve the schema information.
* The Metastore contains details such as table names, column names, data types, and partitioning information.
* The **Hive Metastore** can be stored in various RDBMS systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Derby.

## **5. Execution Engine**

* The **Execution Engine** is responsible for executing the physical plan generated by the compiler. It translates the query into a series of MapReduce jobs or Spark jobs and submits them to the cluster.
* The execution engine handles the actual processing of data and communicates with **HDFS** to read and write data.

## **6. Storage Handlers**

* **Storage Handlers** are responsible for reading and writing data to and from different data storage formats. Hive supports multiple formats like **ORC**, **Parquet**, **Avro**, **RCFile**, and **TextFile**. The storage handlers allow users to store the data in their preferred formats.

## **Hive vs. RDBMS**

While **Hive** shares similarities with **RDBMS** (Relational Database Management Systems) in that both use SQL-like languages to query data, there are key differences between the two, especially regarding performance, data processing models, and usage:

| Feature             | **Hive**                                                                                                 | **RDBMS**                                                             |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Model**      | Schema-on-read, suitable for unstructured and semi-structured data in HDFS.                              | Schema-on-write, stores structured data in tables.                    |
| **Query Language**  | Hive Query Language (HQL), similar to SQL.                                                               | Structured Query Language (SQL).                                      |
| **Performance**     | Optimized for batch processing; slower queries.                                                          | Optimized for real-time transactions and low-latency queries.         |
| **Data Storage**    | Stores data in **HDFS**, no predefined schema.                                                           | Stores data in tables with predefined schemas.                        |
| **Data Processing** | Uses **MapReduce** or **Tez** for execution, which adds overhead.                                        | Uses efficient query execution engines, typically optimized for OLTP. |
| **Scalability**     | Highly scalable, built for massive datasets.                                                             | Scalable, but less efficient at handling massive datasets.            |
| **Transactions**    | No ACID support by default (though newer versions support ACID transactions in specific configurations). | Full ACID compliance for transactions.                                |
| **Indexes**         | Limited support for indexing (works best with partitioning and bucketing).                               | Extensive support for indexing (B-tree, bitmap, etc.).                |

## **When to Use Hive vs. RDBMS:**

* Use **Hive** for batch processing of large, distributed datasets, especially when using Hadoop. It’s ideal for analytical queries over vast amounts of data that don’t require real-time responses.
* Use **RDBMS** for transactional workloads, real-time queries, and applications that require fast, interactive responses, especially for smaller-scale data.

## **Hive Query Language (HQL) Basics**

**Hive Query Language (HQL)** is a query language that is very similar to SQL, designed for querying and managing data in **Hadoop**. It is used for interacting with data stored in Hive tables.

## **Basic HQL Syntax**:

1. **SELECT Query**:
   Hive supports standard `SELECT` queries to retrieve data from tables.

   ```sql
   SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
   ```

2. **Creating a Table**:
   Hive allows you to create tables using the `CREATE TABLE` statement, similar to SQL.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE employees (id INT, name STRING, age INT)
   ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';
   ```

3. **Loading Data**:
   Data can be loaded into a Hive table from an HDFS directory using the `LOAD DATA` command.

   ```sql
   LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/hadoop/employees.csv' INTO TABLE employees;
   ```

4. **Partitioning**:
   Hive supports partitioning to organize large datasets by splitting the data into partitions based on specific column values.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE employees (id INT, name STRING, age INT) PARTITIONED BY (year INT);
   ```

5. **Joining Tables**:
   Hive supports `JOIN` operations similar to SQL.

   ```sql
   SELECT a.id, a.name, b.department FROM employees a 
   JOIN departments b 
   ON a.department_id = b.id;
   ```

6. **Aggregation**:
   Aggregation functions such as `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN` are supported in Hive.

   ```sql
   SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY department;
   ```

## **Hive Metastore and Storage Formats**

## **1. Hive Metastore**

The **Hive Metastore** is a central repository that stores metadata about the Hive tables, including table definitions, column names, types, and location. It provides a centralized location for Hive to retrieve schema information when performing queries. It supports different backends, such as **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, or **Derby**.

* **Advantages**: The Metastore ensures that data in Hive is organized and can be efficiently queried using schema definitions.
* **External Tables**: Hive supports **external tables**, which allows users to store data outside Hive but still query it using Hive.

## **2. Hive Storage Formats**

Hive supports several data formats for storing data in HDFS:

1. **TextFile** (Default):

   * Data is stored as plain text, often in **CSV** or **TSV** format.
   * It’s the most basic format and lacks optimization for large-scale data operations.

2. **ORC (Optimized Row Columnar)**:

   * ORC is a highly optimized columnar storage format that provides compression, high performance, and efficient querying.
   * It is often used for **data warehousing** and analytics workloads.

   Example:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE employees (id INT, name STRING, age INT) 
   STORED AS ORC;
   ```

3. **Parquet**:

   * Parquet is another columnar format, optimized for complex data types and analytical queries. It’s used widely in the **Apache Spark** ecosystem for data processing.

   Example:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE employees (id INT, name STRING, age INT) 
   STORED AS PARQUET;
   ```

4. **Avro**:

   * Avro is a row-based storage format that provides efficient data serialization. It is often used for data transfer and storage in Hadoop.

   Example:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE employees (id INT, name STRING, age INT) 
   STORED AS AVRO;
   ```

5. **RCFile**:

   * RCFile (Record Columnar File) is another columnar format that supports efficient querying. It is used less frequently compared to ORC and Parquet but still has its uses for certain applications.

## **Conclusion**

Hive is a powerful tool that enables efficient querying and analysis of large datasets stored in Hadoop. With its SQL-like query language (HQL), it provides a familiar interface for analysts and data scientists to interact with big data. By leveraging features like **partitioning**, **bucketing**, and integration with tools like **Hive Metastore** and **storage formats** like **ORC** and **Parquet**, Hive is well-suited for **batch processing** and **data warehousing** applications in the Hadoop ecosystem.
