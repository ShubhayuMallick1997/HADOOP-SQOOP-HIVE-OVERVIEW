# 3 . **MapReduce**

## **What is MapReduce?**

MapReduce is a programming model used for processing large datasets in parallel across a distributed cluster. It is one of the core components of the Hadoop ecosystem and allows for the parallel processing of data stored in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). The main goal of MapReduce is to break down a large task into smaller sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel, significantly speeding up the processing time for large datasets.

MapReduce works in two primary phases:

1. **Map Phase**:

   * In the Map phase, the input data is divided into chunks and distributed across the cluster. Each chunk is processed by a **Map function**, which processes each record and produces key-value pairs.
   * For example, if you're processing a collection of text data to count the number of occurrences of each word, the Map function would take a chunk of the data, break it into words, and emit a key-value pair where the key is the word and the value is the count (initially 1).

2. **Reduce Phase**:

   * After the Map phase, the key-value pairs are shuffled and sorted. All values for the same key are grouped together.
   * In the Reduce phase, the **Reduce function** processes each group of key-value pairs and combines the values to generate the final result. For example, if multiple key-value pairs for the same word were produced by the Map function, the Reduce function would sum the counts to get the total count of that word across the entire dataset.

The MapReduce model is highly parallelizable, meaning tasks can be divided into smaller sub-tasks and executed concurrently, which makes it very suitable for processing large datasets.

## **MapReduce Architecture**

MapReduce is based on a master-slave architecture, where there are two primary components:

1. **JobTracker** (Master Node):

   * The JobTracker is responsible for managing and scheduling MapReduce jobs across the cluster.
   * It receives job requests from clients and divides them into smaller tasks.
   * The JobTracker coordinates the execution of tasks, monitors their progress, and handles failure recovery.

2. **TaskTracker** (Worker Node):

   * TaskTrackers are the worker nodes in the Hadoop cluster.
   * Each TaskTracker is responsible for executing the Map and Reduce tasks assigned to it by the JobTracker.
   * The TaskTracker also sends periodic heartbeats to the JobTracker, reporting on the status of task execution.

## **How MapReduce Works**

1. **Input Split**:

   * The input data (e.g., files stored in HDFS) is split into smaller pieces known as **input splits**.
   * Each split is processed by a separate map task. The size of the input split is typically configured based on the size of the data and the number of available nodes in the cluster.

2. **Mapping**:

   * Each **map task** reads its input split, processes the data, and produces intermediate key-value pairs.
   * The output of the map task is stored in a buffer in memory, and once the buffer is full, it is written to disk. This is called the **Map output**.

3. **Shuffling and Sorting**:

   * After the Map phase completes, the **shuffle** phase begins. This phase involves grouping all the intermediate key-value pairs from the Map tasks by key.
   * The data is **sorted** by key, so that all values for the same key are grouped together and ready for processing by the Reduce function.

4. **Reducing**:

   * The **reduce tasks** receive sorted key-value pairs from the shuffle phase. Each reduce task processes one key and all its associated values.
   * The Reduce function aggregates the values and outputs a final key-value pair.
   * For example, in a word count program, the key would be the word, and the value would be the total count of that word across all the input data.

5. **Output**:

   * The final output of the Reduce phase is written to HDFS or another storage system.

## **MapReduce Example: Word Count**

Hereâ€™s an example of how a simple MapReduce job would work for counting the frequency of words in a text file:

1. **Map Function**:

   * The map function processes each line of the text, splits the line into words, and emits key-value pairs where the key is the word, and the value is 1.
   * Example:

     * Input: `"hello world hello"`
     * Output (from Map function):

       * `("hello", 1)`,
       * `("world", 1)`,
       * `("hello", 1)`.

2. **Shuffle and Sort**:

   * The shuffle phase groups all occurrences of the same word together.
   * Example:

     * Input after shuffle:

       * `("hello", [1, 1])`,
       * `("world", [1])`.

3. **Reduce Function**:

   * The reduce function processes each key (word) and its associated list of values (counts), and sums the values to get the total count for each word.
   * Example:

     * Input for Reduce function:

       * `("hello", [1, 1])`,
       * `("world", [1])`.
     * Output from Reduce function:

       * `("hello", 2)`,
       * `("world", 1)`.

4. **Final Output**:

   * The final output of the MapReduce job is a list of words and their counts.
   * Example Output:

     * `("hello", 2)`,
     * `("world", 1)`.

## **MapReduce Execution Workflow**

1. **Submit the Job**: The client submits the MapReduce job to the JobTracker.
2. **Job Initialization**: The JobTracker divides the job into map and reduce tasks and assigns them to TaskTrackers.
3. **Map Phase**: The TaskTrackers execute the map tasks in parallel on the input data.
4. **Shuffle and Sort**: After all the map tasks complete, the intermediate results are shuffled and sorted to prepare for the reduce phase.
5. **Reduce Phase**: The reduce tasks process the sorted data and produce the final output.
6. **Job Completion**: The JobTracker collects the results from the reduce tasks and stores them in HDFS.

## **MapReduce Configuration Parameters**

Here are some commonly used configuration parameters in a MapReduce job:

* **mapreduce.map.memory.mb**: The amount of memory to allocate for each map task.
* **mapreduce.reduce.memory.mb**: The amount of memory to allocate for each reduce task.
* **mapreduce.input.fileinputformat.split.minsize**: Minimum size of input splits.
* **mapreduce.output.fileoutputformat.compress**: Whether to compress the output of the MapReduce job.
* **mapreduce.job.reduces**: The number of reduce tasks to allocate for the job.

## **MapReduce Optimizations**

MapReduce jobs can sometimes be slow, especially when working with large datasets. Here are some optimization techniques:

1. **Combiner**:

   * The combiner is a mini-reducer that runs on the map side to aggregate intermediate results before they are sent to the reducer. This reduces the amount of data shuffled between the map and reduce phases.

2. **Data Locality**:

   * Ensuring that the data is processed on the node where it resides can improve performance. Hadoop tries to schedule tasks on nodes where the data is already available.

3. **Speculative Execution**:

   * In speculative execution, if a task is running slower than expected, Hadoop can run another copy of the task on a different node to complete it more quickly.

4. **Tuning Map and Reduce Tasks**:

   * Adjust the number of map and reduce tasks to optimize the performance. More tasks can help distribute the load better but can also lead to overhead.

5. **Compression**:

   * Compressing intermediate data can reduce the amount of data transferred across the network, improving performance.

## **MapReduce Job Flow in Hadoop Cluster**

1. **Job Submission**: The user submits a MapReduce job to the JobTracker.
2. **Task Assignment**: The JobTracker assigns map and reduce tasks to TaskTrackers.
3. **Map Task Execution**: TaskTrackers execute the Map tasks and generate intermediate key-value pairs.
4. **Shuffle and Sort**: The intermediate data is shuffled and sorted.
5. **Reduce Task Execution**: TaskTrackers execute the Reduce tasks to aggregate the results.
6. **Final Output**: The output is stored in HDFS, and the job is marked as complete.

### **What is MapReduce?**

**MapReduce** is a programming model and processing technique used to process large-scale data in a distributed and parallel manner across a Hadoop cluster. It enables developers to write programs that process vast amounts of data by dividing tasks into smaller sub-tasks, which can then be processed in parallel across multiple nodes in the cluster.

The core idea behind MapReduce is the **divide and conquer** principle: the data is divided into smaller pieces, processed independently (in parallel), and then aggregated to produce the final result.

MapReduce consists of two primary functions:

1. **Map**: The Map function processes input data and produces a set of intermediate key-value pairs.
2. **Reduce**: The Reduce function processes those key-value pairs and produces the final output by aggregating them.

MapReduce is widely used in the Hadoop ecosystem, primarily to process large amounts of unstructured and structured data.

### **MapReduce Architecture**

The MapReduce architecture is based on a **master-slave** model with two main components:

1. **JobTracker (Master Node)**:

   * The **JobTracker** is responsible for managing the MapReduce jobs. It schedules tasks (Map and Reduce tasks) to be executed by worker nodes (TaskTrackers).
   * It monitors job progress, handles task failures (retries), and coordinates the overall execution.

2. **TaskTracker (Worker Node)**:

   * **TaskTrackers** are responsible for executing the tasks assigned by the JobTracker.
   * Each TaskTracker runs both the Map and Reduce tasks, processes data, and reports back to the JobTracker with the progress and status of the tasks.

3. **Input Splits**:

   * The **Input Split** divides the input data into chunks (typically one split per map task). These splits are passed to the Mappers for parallel processing.

4. **Map Tasks**:

   * The **Map function** takes an input split and produces intermediate key-value pairs. The Map function is applied independently to each record within the split.

5. **Shuffle and Sort**:

   * After the Map phase, the **Shuffle and Sort** phase is responsible for grouping all intermediate key-value pairs based on the key.
   * The data is sorted and organized before being passed to the Reducers for further aggregation.

6. **Reduce Tasks**:

   * The **Reduce function** processes each group of intermediate key-value pairs and produces the final output. The data for the same key (as generated by the Map function) is collected and combined (summed, averaged, etc.).

7. **Output**:

   * The final results of the Reduce phase are stored in HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), or any other configured storage.

### **Working of MapReduce (Map, Shuffle, Reduce)**

#### **1. Map Phase**

* The Map function processes each input record (one record at a time).
* Each input record is transformed into a set of **intermediate key-value pairs**.
* For example, in a word count program, the input might be lines of text, and the output of the Map function would be key-value pairs where the key is the word, and the value is `1`.

**Example**:

```java
public class Mapper extends MapReduceBase implements Mapper<LongWritable, Text, Text, IntWritable> {
    private final static IntWritable one = new IntWritable(1);
    private Text word = new Text();

    public void map(LongWritable key, Text value, OutputCollector<Text, IntWritable> output, Reporter reporter) throws IOException {
        String line = value.toString();
        StringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(line);
        
        while (tokenizer.hasMoreTokens()) {
            word.set(tokenizer.nextToken());
            output.collect(word, one);  // Emit intermediate (word, 1)
        }
    }
}
```

Here, the Map function emits each word along with `1`.

#### **2. Shuffle and Sort Phase**

* After the Map phase, the intermediate key-value pairs are sorted and grouped by key. This phase is critical for ensuring that all values corresponding to the same key are brought together.
* The shuffle process redistributes the intermediate data across the cluster, and the data is sorted to ensure that the Reducer receives key-value pairs grouped by key.

#### **3. Reduce Phase**

* The Reduce function takes the grouped key-value pairs, processes them, and produces a final output.
* The Reducer processes the data for each unique key, aggregates the values, and generates a result.
* For the word count example, the Reducer sums the counts of each word across all mappers and produces the final count for each word.

**Example**:

```java
public class Reducer extends MapReduceBase implements Reducer<Text, IntWritable, Text, IntWritable> {
    public void reduce(Text key, Iterator<IntWritable> values, OutputCollector<Text, IntWritable> output, Reporter reporter) throws IOException {
        int sum = 0;
        
        while (values.hasNext()) {
            sum += values.next().get();  // Sum the values for the same word
        }
        
        output.collect(key, new IntWritable(sum));  // Emit final word count
    }
}
```

### **Writing a MapReduce Program in Java**

A basic **WordCount** MapReduce program involves creating three main components:

1. **Mapper**: Processes input data and emits intermediate key-value pairs.
2. **Reducer**: Takes grouped key-value pairs and aggregates them.
3. **Driver**: Configures the job, including specifying the input and output paths, and sets up the Map and Reduce functions.

**Example WordCount Program**:

```java
import org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration;
import org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path;
import org.apache.hadoop.io.IntWritable;
import org.apache.hadoop.io.Text;
import org.apache.hadoop.mapred.*;
import org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.input.FileInputFormat;
import org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.output.FileOutputFormat;

public class WordCount {

    public static class MapperClass extends Mapper<Object, Text, Text, IntWritable> {
        private final static IntWritable one = new IntWritable(1);
        private Text word = new Text();

        public void map(Object key, Text value, Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
            String line = value.toString();
            StringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(line);

            while (tokenizer.hasMoreTokens()) {
                word.set(tokenizer.nextToken());
                context.write(word, one);  // Emit (word, 1)
            }
        }
    }

    public static class ReducerClass extends Reducer<Text, IntWritable, Text, IntWritable> {
        public void reduce(Text key, Iterable<IntWritable> values, Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
            int sum = 0;

            for (IntWritable val : values) {
                sum += val.get();  // Sum all occurrences of the word
            }

            context.write(key, new IntWritable(sum));  // Emit (word, count)
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Configuration conf = new Configuration();
        Job job = Job.getInstance(conf, "Word Count");

        job.setJarByClass(WordCount.class);
        job.setMapperClass(MapperClass.class);
        job.setCombinerClass(ReducerClass.class);  // Optional: Combiner for local aggregation
        job.setReducerClass(ReducerClass.class);

        job.setOutputKeyClass(Text.class);
        job.setOutputValueClass(IntWritable.class);

        FileInputFormat.addInputPath(job, new Path(args[0]));
        FileOutputFormat.setOutputPath(job, new Path(args[1]));

        System.exit(job.waitForCompletion(true) ? 0 : 1);
    }
}
```

* **Mapper** emits each word with a value of `1`.
* **Reducer** aggregates counts for each word.

---

### **Combiner Functions and Partitioner**

#### **1. Combiner Functions**

A **Combiner** is a mini-reducer that runs on the Mapper side to reduce the amount of data shuffled between the Map and Reduce phases. It performs local aggregation before sending data to the Reducer. Combiners are optional and are only used if the Reduce function is associative and commutative (i.e., the order of applying the operation doesn't matter).

For example, in the **WordCount** program, the Combiner can be used to sum counts of words locally on the Mapper side.

```java
public static class CombinerClass extends Reducer<Text, IntWritable, Text, IntWritable> {
    public void reduce(Text key, Iterable<IntWritable> values, Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
        int sum = 0;
        for (IntWritable val : values) {
            sum += val.get();
        }
        context.write(key, new IntWritable(sum));
    }
}
```

You can specify the Combiner class in the job configuration:

```java
job.setCombinerClass(CombinerClass.class);
```

#### **2. Partitioner**

A **Partitioner** controls how the data is distributed across the different Reducers. By default, Hadoop assigns keys to Reducers based on a hash of the key, but you can define a custom Partitioner if you want a more specific partitioning scheme.

For example, if you want words starting with letters 'A' through 'M' to go to one Reducer, and 'N' through 'Z' to go to another, you can define a custom Partitioner like this:

```java
public static class CustomPartitioner extends Partitioner<Text, IntWritable> {
    public int getPartition(Text key, IntWritable value, int numPartitions) {
        char firstChar = key.toString().charAt(0);
        if (firstChar >= 'A' && firstChar <= 'M') {
            return 0;  // Assign to the first Reducer
        } else {
            return 1;  // Assign to the second Reducer
        }
    }
}
```

You can set the Partitioner for the job:

```java
job.setPartitionerClass(CustomPartitioner.class);
```
