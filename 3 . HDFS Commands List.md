# 3 . **HDFS Commands List :**

Here is a list of **HDFS commands** that are used for managing files and directories in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). These commands are typically run via the `hdfs dfs` command-line utility.

### **Common Options for HDFS Commands**

* `-R` : Recursively list the contents of a directory.
* `-f` : Force the operation to be executed without confirmation.
* `-s` : Display summary information (for commands like `du`).
* `-p` : Preserve the file attributes when copying or moving files.
* `-v` : Enable verbose output for more detailed information.

These commands provide a variety of functions for interacting with HDFS, from basic file management to more advanced administrative tasks such as changing permissions, setting replication factors, and checking the status of the filesystem.
