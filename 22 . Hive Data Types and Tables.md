# 22 . **Hive Data Types and Tables**

In Hive, data is organized into tables and can be queried using SQL-like queries. Hive supports a variety of data types and allows for managing tables in different ways (managed and external). Additionally, partitioning and bucketing provide ways to optimize data storage and query performance.

---

## **1. Hive Data Types**

Hive supports a wide range of data types, including primitive types (like integers and strings) and complex types (like arrays, maps, and structs). Below is a breakdown of the major data types in Hive:

## **1.1 Primitive Data Types**

* **INT**: Represents a 32-bit signed integer. It is used for whole numbers.

  * Example: `123`
* **BIGINT**: Represents a 64-bit signed integer. It is used for large whole numbers.

  * Example: `123456789`
* **STRING**: Represents a string of characters (text). Strings can include letters, numbers, and special characters.

  * Example: `'Hello, Hive!'`
* **BOOLEAN**: Represents a boolean value (true/false).

  * Example: `true`, `false`
* **FLOAT**: Represents a 32-bit floating point number (decimal).

  * Example: `3.14`
* **DOUBLE**: Represents a 64-bit floating point number.

  * Example: `3.14159`
* **DECIMAL**: Represents exact decimal numbers. Useful for high precision calculations (e.g., monetary values).

  * Example: `DECIMAL(10, 2)` for `12345.67`
* **DATE**: Represents a date (YYYY-MM-DD). It stores the date without the time.

  * Example: `'2021-08-15'`
* **TIMESTAMP**: Represents both date and time (YYYY-MM-DD HH\:MM\:SS).

  * Example: `'2021-08-15 14:30:00'`
* **VARCHAR**: A string of variable length. It is used for short strings (less than 32767 characters).

  * Example: `'Hive Query Language'`

## **1.2 Complex Data Types**

* **ARRAY**: Represents an ordered collection of elements, where all elements must have the same type.

  * Example: `ARRAY<STRING>` for a list of strings, e.g., `['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']`

* **MAP**: Represents a key-value pair where the key and value can be of any data type. The keys must be unique.

  * Example: `MAP<STRING, INT>` for a map of strings and integers, e.g., `{'apple': 1, 'banana': 2}`

* **STRUCT**: Represents a collection of fields, where each field can have a different data type.

  * Example: `STRUCT<name: STRING, age: INT>` for representing a person with a name and age.

* **UNIONTYPE**: Allows a field to contain one of multiple different types. It's used when the value can vary between types.

  * Example: `UNIONTYPE<INT, STRING>` for a field that could hold either an integer or a string.

## **2. Creating Tables in Hive (Managed and External)**

Hive allows you to create **managed tables** and **external tables**. The key difference between the two is how Hive manages the data storage.

## **2.1 Managed Tables in Hive**

A **managed table** is a table in which Hive takes full responsibility for both the data and metadata. When you drop a managed table, Hive will delete the data stored in the table along with the metadata.

**Syntax to Create a Managed Table**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT,
    name STRING,
    age INT
)
STORED AS ORC;
```

* In this example, a **managed table** `employees` is created with columns `id`, `name`, and `age`, and the data is stored in the **ORC** file format.

## **2.2 External Tables in Hive**

An **external table** is a table in which Hive only manages the metadata (schema) and not the data. The data for an external table exists outside of Hive, and dropping the table in Hive does not delete the data from the underlying file system (HDFS or S3). External tables are useful when you want to share data between multiple applications or retain data even after dropping the table.

**Syntax to Create an External Table**:

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE employees (
    id INT,
    name STRING,
    age INT
)
STORED AS TEXTFILE
LOCATION '/user/hadoop/employees_data';
```

* **`CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE`**: Defines the table as an external table.
* **`LOCATION`**: Specifies the directory in HDFS where the data resides.
* In this case, the table `employees` is created with an external location at `/user/hadoop/employees_data` in HDFS.

## **2.3 Managed vs. External Tables**:

| Feature             | **Managed Table**                         | **External Table**                                        |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Management** | Hive manages both data and metadata       | Hive manages only metadata, data is external              |
| **Data Deletion**   | Data is deleted when the table is dropped | Data is not deleted when the table is dropped             |
| **Default Usage**   | Default for new tables in Hive            | Useful when the data is shared or controlled outside Hive |

## **3. Partitioning and Bucketing in Hive**

Hive supports **partitioning** and **bucketing** to improve query performance, especially when dealing with large datasets. Both are techniques used to organize data in a way that makes it easier to query, particularly for filtering and grouping operations.

## **3.1 Partitioning in Hive**

Partitioning divides a table into smaller, manageable parts based on the value of one or more columns. Partitions in Hive are physical directories in HDFS, and each partition holds a subset of data that corresponds to a specific value or range of values in the partitioning column.

* **Example**: Partitioning a table by `year` and `month`.

**Syntax to Create a Partitioned Table**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT,
    name STRING,
    age INT
)
PARTITIONED BY (year INT, month INT)
STORED AS ORC;
```

* **`PARTITIONED BY (year INT, month INT)`**: Specifies the columns to partition the data by.

When loading data into a partitioned table, you specify the partition values, which helps organize the data into directories based on those values:

```sql
LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/hadoop/employees_2021_01' INTO TABLE employees PARTITION (year=2021, month=1);
```

## **3.2 Bucketing in Hive**

**Bucketing** further divides a partition into more manageable parts (buckets) based on a hashing function. It is typically used when partitioning alone is not sufficient to balance the data and improve query performance.

* **Example**: Bucketing a table by `id` into 4 buckets.

**Syntax to Create a Bucketed Table**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT,
    name STRING,
    age INT
)
CLUSTERED BY (id) INTO 4 BUCKETS
STORED AS ORC;
```

* **`CLUSTERED BY (id) INTO 4 BUCKETS`**: Specifies that the data will be bucketed by the `id` column into 4 buckets.

Bucketing is often used in combination with partitioning to organize data further and optimize queries. When performing a `JOIN` operation on bucketed tables, Hive can optimize the query execution by using **map-side joins**.

## **3.3 Partitioning vs. Bucketing**:

| Feature               | **Partitioning**                                                 | **Bucketing**                                                         |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Organization** | Divides data into directories based on column values             | Divides data into files (buckets) using hashing                       |
| **Use Case**          | Optimizes queries on partitioned column values                   | Improves performance of joins and aggregations                        |
| **Efficiency**        | Efficient for large datasets with filtering on partition columns | Useful for more granular organization of data, particularly for joins |

## **4. Loading and Querying Data in Hive**

## **4.1 Loading Data into Hive**

You can load data into Hive tables from files stored in HDFS using the `LOAD DATA` command. This is typically used to load data from **HDFS** or **local files** into Hive tables.

* **Example**: Loading data from HDFS into a managed table:

  ```sql
  LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/hadoop/employees_data.csv' INTO TABLE employees;
  ```

* **Example**: Loading data into a partitioned table:

  ```sql
  LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/hadoop/employees_2021_01.csv' INTO TABLE employees PARTITION (year=2021, month=1);
  ```

## **4.2 Querying Data in Hive**

Hive supports standard SQL-like querying using **HQL (Hive Query Language)**. It allows users to perform a wide range of operations such as filtering, grouping, joining, and aggregating data.

* **Example**: Simple SELECT query:

  ```sql
  SELECT id, name, age FROM employees;
  ```

* **Example**: Filtering data using a `WHERE` clause:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age > 30;
  ```

* **Example**: Grouping data and performing aggregation:

  ```sql
  SELECT year, month, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY year, month;
  ```

* **Example**: Joining two tables:

  ```sql
  SELECT e.id, e.name, d.department_name
  FROM employees e
  JOIN departments d
  ON e.department_id = d.id;
  ```
