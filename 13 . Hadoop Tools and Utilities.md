# 13 . **Hadoop Tools and Utilities**

## **1. HDFS Commands and Operations**

HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) commands are used to interact with the files stored in HDFS. Some of the common commands include:

* **Listing Files**:

  * `hdfs dfs -ls /path/to/directory`: Lists files and directories in the specified HDFS path.
  * Example: `hdfs dfs -ls /user/hadoop`

* **Creating Directories**:

  * `hdfs dfs -mkdir /path/to/directory`: Creates a new directory in HDFS.
  * Example: `hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/hadoop/new_dir`

* **Copying Files**:

  * `hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal <local_path> <hdfs_path>`: Copies a file from the local file system to HDFS.
  * Example: `hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal /home/user/data.txt /user/hadoop/data/`

* **Deleting Files**:

  * `hdfs dfs -rm /path/to/file`: Deletes a file or directory from HDFS.
  * Example: `hdfs dfs -rm /user/hadoop/data.txt`

* **Viewing File Content**:

  * `hdfs dfs -cat /path/to/file`: Displays the contents of a file stored in HDFS.
  * Example: `hdfs dfs -cat /user/hadoop/data.txt`

## **2. Hadoop Daemons**

Hadoop runs several daemons to handle different functions within the Hadoop cluster:

* **NameNode**: Manages the file system namespace and metadata. It tracks the location of data blocks across the cluster.
* **DataNode**: Stores actual data and handles read/write requests from clients.
* **ResourceManager**: Manages resources in the cluster for job execution.
* **NodeManager**: Manages the execution of tasks on individual nodes.
* **JobTracker**: Manages job scheduling (replaced by ResourceManager in YARN).
* **TaskTracker**: Executes tasks (replaced by NodeManager in YARN).

## **3. Hadoop Configuration (core-site.xml, hdfs-site.xml)**

Hadoop configurations are typically stored in XML files, such as:

* **core-site.xml**: Configures the general Hadoop settings like HDFS URI, default file system, etc.

  * Example:

    ```xml
    <configuration>
      <property>
        <name>fs.defaultFS</name>
        <value>hdfs://namenode_host:8020</value>
      </property>
    </configuration>
    ```

* **hdfs-site.xml**: Contains HDFS-specific configurations like replication factor, block size, and storage directories.

  * Example:

    ```xml
    <configuration>
      <property>
        <name>dfs.replication</name>
        <value>3</value>
      </property>
      <property>
        <name>dfs.namenode.name.dir</name>
        <value>/hadoop/hdfs/namenode</value>
      </property>
    </configuration>
    ```

## **4. Hadoop Cluster Setup and Configuration**

Setting up a Hadoop cluster involves configuring multiple machines, each with Hadoop daemons (e.g., NameNode, DataNode). Some key steps include:

1. **Install Java**: Hadoop requires Java to be installed on all nodes.
2. **Configure SSH**: Set up passwordless SSH between cluster nodes.
3. **Distribute Hadoop**: Install Hadoop on all nodes in the cluster.
4. **Configure Configuration Files**:

   * Edit `core-site.xml`, `hdfs-site.xml`, `yarn-site.xml`, and `mapred-site.xml` to specify HDFS URIs, YARN settings, etc.
5. **Start Hadoop Daemons**: Run the necessary commands to start Hadoop daemons on all nodes (e.g., `start-dfs.sh`, `start-yarn.sh`).

## **Hadoop Advanced Concepts**

## **1. Hadoop Performance Optimization**

Performance optimization involves tuning Hadoop configurations for better resource utilization and faster job execution.

* **Memory Management**: Tuning Java heap size and memory allocation for MapReduce jobs can significantly affect performance. Parameters like `mapreduce.map.memory.mb` and `mapreduce.reduce.memory.mb` control the memory settings for map and reduce tasks.
* **Compression**: Compressing the data (e.g., using Snappy or Gzip) during both storage and transfer can reduce disk I/O and network congestion.
* **Task Parallelism**: Configuring the number of map and reduce tasks allows you to fine-tune the degree of parallelism in your jobs.
* **Data Locality**: Ensuring that MapReduce tasks are executed on the nodes where the data resides (data locality) helps improve performance by reducing network I/O.

## **2. Tuning MapReduce Jobs**

Optimizing MapReduce jobs involves adjusting various parameters for better performance:

* **Split Size**: The size of splits (chunks of input data) can be adjusted. Smaller splits allow for better parallelization but can lead to overhead, so it's important to balance split sizes for optimal performance.
* **Combiner**: A combiner reduces the amount of data transferred between the map and reduce phases by performing a local aggregation. For example, for a word count program, a combiner can be used to perform partial aggregation on the map side.
* **Shuffling and Sorting**: The shuffle and sort phase is one of the most time-consuming parts of MapReduce. Tuning memory settings for this phase (e.g., `mapreduce.shuffle.input.buffer.percent`) can improve job performance.

## **3. Hadoop Security (Kerberos Authentication, HDFS Permissions)**

Security in Hadoop involves setting up proper authentication and authorization mechanisms:

* **Kerberos Authentication**: Hadoop can use Kerberos for secure authentication. Kerberos ensures that data in the cluster is accessed by authorized users and services.
* **HDFS Permissions**: HDFS follows a POSIX-style permission model (read, write, execute). Access control lists (ACLs) can also be used to manage permissions at a more granular level.

## **4. Troubleshooting Hadoop Jobs**

Troubleshooting Hadoop jobs involves using logs, monitoring tools, and metrics to identify and fix performance bottlenecks or failures.

* **JobTracker Logs**: Logs provide details on job execution, including error messages and progress.
* **ResourceManager UI**: The YARN ResourceManager UI allows you to track job statuses and identify resource allocation issues.
* **HDFS Health Check**: Use the `hdfs fsck` command to check the health of your HDFS filesystem and fix any issues related to data blocks.

## **5. Hadoop Federation**

Hadoop Federation allows multiple independent NameNodes to manage different parts of the HDFS namespace. It improves scalability by allowing large clusters to be divided into smaller, manageable units, each with its own NameNode. This allows Hadoop to scale out across multiple namespaces, providing better performance and easier management.
