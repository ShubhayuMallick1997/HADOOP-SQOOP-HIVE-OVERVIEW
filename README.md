# Hadoop, Sqoop, and Hive Overview - A Comprehensive Guide by Shubhayu Mallick

## Greetings 👋

Welcome to the **Hadoop, Sqoop, and Hive Overview** repository! I'm **Shubhayu Mallick**, and I'm excited to share this journey of learning and mastering the powerful big data tools **Hadoop**, **Sqoop**, and **Hive** with you. Whether you're just starting with big data technologies or looking to enhance your skills, this guide covers everything from **data ingestion** and **transformation** to **advanced querying techniques** in a distributed environment.

### **What You’ll Learn**

* How to **ingest data** into Hadoop using **Sqoop** and **Hive** for data warehousing and processing.
* The basics and advanced concepts of **HiveQL**, a SQL-like query language for **Apache Hive**.
* How to leverage **Hadoop’s distributed storage** (HDFS) and **MapReduce** for efficient data processing at scale.
* Best practices for managing large datasets in **Hadoop**, working with **Sqoop** for importing and exporting data between relational databases and **Hadoop**, and querying structured data with **Hive**.

Dive in, and let’s explore the world of **big data** together, empowering you to master **Hadoop**, **Sqoop**, and **Hive** for scalable data solutions!
