# 27 . **Advanced Hive Features**

Hive provides many advanced features that enhance its flexibility, performance, and usability. These features allow for custom functionality, optimized querying, transactional support, and integration with external sources. Here is a breakdown of some of the key advanced features of Hive:

---

## **1. Hive UDFs (User Defined Functions)**

**User Defined Functions (UDFs)** in Hive are custom functions that extend the capabilities of HiveQL by allowing you to implement your own functions to process data in ways not covered by the built-in functions. UDFs allow users to create complex transformations or aggregations that are not available through Hive's default set of functions.

## **1.1 Types of UDFs in Hive**

* **UDF (User Defined Function)**: Allows you to define custom logic that can be used in queries. It typically operates on a single input record and returns a result.
* **UDAF (User Defined Aggregation Function)**: Allows you to define custom aggregation logic, like `COUNT` or `SUM`. These functions operate over a set of input rows.
* **UDTF (User Defined Table Function)**: Allows you to define custom logic that can return multiple rows as output for each input row (useful for generating a table-like structure from a single row).

## **1.2 Example of a Simple UDF**

To create a custom UDF, you need to write the function in Java and then register it in Hive.

**1.2.1 Writing a Simple UDF**:

```java
import org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.UDF;
import org.apache.hadoop.io.Text;

public class UpperCaseUDF extends UDF {
    public Text evaluate(Text input) {
        if (input == null) {
            return null;
        }
        return new Text(input.toString().toUpperCase());
    }
}
```

This UDF takes a string and returns it in uppercase.

**1.2.2 Registering the UDF in Hive**:
Once the Java class is compiled and packaged into a JAR file, you can register the UDF with Hive using:

```sql
ADD JAR /path/to/UpperCaseUDF.jar;
CREATE FUNCTION upper_case AS 'com.example.UpperCaseUDF';
```

Now, you can use the `upper_case` function in your Hive queries:

```sql
SELECT upper_case(name) FROM employees;
```

## **1.3 Benefits of UDFs**

* **Customization**: You can implement custom logic and computations that aren't natively available in Hive.
* **Extensibility**: UDFs can extend Hive's capabilities for various use cases, such as string manipulation, date operations, and custom aggregations.

## **2. Hive Views and Indexes**

## **2.1 Hive Views**

A **view** in Hive is a virtual table based on the result of a query. It allows users to simplify complex queries, reuse query logic, and abstract away complicated operations.

* **Syntax** to Create a View:

  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW view_name AS
  SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
  ```

* **Example**:

  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW employee_view AS
  SELECT name, age FROM employees WHERE age > 30;
  ```

  This creates a view called `employee_view` that selects only employees older than 30 years from the `employees` table.

* **Querying a View**:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM employee_view;
  ```

## **2.2 Hive Indexes**

Indexes in Hive are used to speed up query performance by allowing quick lookups on specific columns. Indexing can improve query performance for read-heavy workloads, especially for filtering or joining large datasets.

* **Creating an Index**:

  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX employee_idx ON TABLE employees (name) AS 'COMPACT' WITH DEFERRED REBUILD;
  ```

  In this example, an index is created on the `name` column of the `employees` table. The index will improve queries that filter based on the `name` column.

* **Rebuilding the Index**:
  After creating an index, it must be rebuilt to be used in queries:

  ```sql
  ALTER INDEX employee_idx ON employees REBUILD;
  ```

* **Types of Indexes**:

  * **Compact Index**: Stores index data in a compact format to reduce storage requirements.
  * **Bitmap Index**: Ideal for low-cardinality columns (e.g., boolean flags) where there are only a few distinct values.

## **2.3 Limitations of Indexes**

* Indexes are only useful when the query filters or joins on indexed columns.
* Index creation and maintenance can add overhead during insert operations.
* Not all Hive storage formats support indexing (e.g., ORC and Parquet donâ€™t require indexing due to their optimized columnar storage).

## **3. ACID Transactions in Hive**

**ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)** transactions in Hive provide the ability to perform multiple operations (like inserts, updates, and deletes) on tables in a single, transactional unit. This feature was introduced in Hive 0.14 and further enhanced in later versions to bring full ACID compliance.

## **3.1 Enabling ACID Transactions in Hive**

To enable ACID transactions in Hive, you need to set the following properties in `hive-site.xml`:

```xml
<property>
  <name>hive.support.concurrency</name>
  <value>true</value>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hive.enforce.bucketing</name>
  <value>true</value>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode</name>
  <value>nonstrict</value>
</property>
```

* **`hive.support.concurrency`**: Enables ACID support.
* **`hive.enforce.bucketing`**: Enforces bucketing for tables, which is required for ACID transactions.
* **`hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode`**: Allows dynamic partitioning for ACID transactions.

## **3.2 ACID Operations in Hive**

Hive supports the following ACID operations:

* **INSERT**: Insert data into a table with transactional guarantees.
* **UPDATE**: Update data in a table in an atomic manner.
* **DELETE**: Delete data from a table with transactional guarantees.

**Example - Inserting Data with ACID**:

```sql
INSERT INTO TABLE employees VALUES (101, 'Alice', 30);
```

**Example - Deleting Data with ACID**:

```sql
DELETE FROM employees WHERE age < 25;
```

**Example - Updating Data with ACID**:

```sql
UPDATE employees SET age = 31 WHERE id = 101;
```

## **3.3 Benefits of ACID Transactions in Hive**

* **Atomicity**: Ensures that changes to data are applied in an all-or-nothing manner.
* **Consistency**: Guarantees that data remains in a valid state even after an update, delete, or insert.
* **Concurrency Control**: Allows multiple users to simultaneously query and modify data without conflict.

## **3.4 Limitations**

* ACID transactions are available only in **bucketed tables**.
* Performance overhead is involved due to the transactional log and increased locking mechanisms.

## **4. External Tables and Loading Data from External Sources**

## **4.1 External Tables**

An **external table** in Hive is one where the data exists outside Hive's control. Unlike managed tables, where Hive owns both the data and metadata, external tables are used when the data resides in a non-Hive-managed location (like an HDFS path or an S3 bucket).

**Example**:

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE employees (
    id INT,
    name STRING,
    age INT
)
STORED AS ORC
LOCATION '/user/hadoop/employees_data';
```

* **`LOCATION`**: Specifies the external directory in HDFS or another file system.

## **4.2 Loading Data from External Sources**

Hive allows loading data from external sources like **HDFS**, **local files**, or **external databases** (via **Sqoop** or **Flume**). The `LOAD DATA` command is used to load external data into a Hive table, either managed or external.

**Example - Loading Data from HDFS**:

```sql
LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/hadoop/employees.csv' INTO TABLE employees;
```

**Example - Loading Data from Local File System**:

```sql
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/hadoop/employees.csv' INTO TABLE employees;
```

**Example - Using Sqoop to Load Data from RDBMS**:

```bash
sqoop import --connect jdbc:mysql://localhost/mydb --username root --password password \
  --table employees --hive-import --hive-table employees;
```

## **4.3 Benefits of External Tables**

* External tables allow you to share data between Hive and other applications without modifying or moving the original data.
* Data can be stored outside Hive but still queried within Hive using SQL-like queries.

## **5. Hive on Tez and Hive on Spark**

Hive can run on different execution engines, such as **Tez** and **Spark**, to improve performance over the traditional **MapReduce** engine. These execution engines provide better query performance and faster processing times for complex operations.

## **5.1 Hive on Tez**

**Apache Tez** is a data processing framework that runs on top of Hadoop, designed for more efficient execution of DAG-based (Directed Acyclic Graph) jobs. It optimizes query execution by reducing the overhead of MapReduce, offering better performance for complex queries.

**Enabling Hive on Tez**:
To use **Tez** as the execution engine in Hive, configure the following properties in `hive-site.xml`:

```xml
<property>
  <name>hive.execution.engine</name>
  <value>tez</value>
</property>
```

## **5.2 Hive on Spark**

**Apache Spark** is another execution engine that can run Hive queries, providing even faster performance, especially for iterative and in-memory operations. Spark leverages **in-memory computing** and optimizes query execution significantly compared to Tez and MapReduce.

**Enabling Hive on Spark**:
To use **Spark** as the execution engine in Hive, set the following configuration:

```xml
<property>
  <name>hive.execution.engine</name>
  <value>spark</value>
</property>
```

## **5.3 Benefits of Hive on Tez and Hive on Spark**

* **Improved Performance**: Both Tez and Spark can process queries faster than the traditional MapReduce engine.
* **Better Resource Utilization**: These engines utilize cluster resources more efficiently, especially for complex joins, aggregations, and data-intensive queries.
* **Faster Query Execution**: Particularly for iterative queries and interactive analysis, **Spark** offers a significant speed advantage due to its in-memory processing.

---

## **Conclusion**

Hive's **advanced features** such as **UDFs**, **ACID transactions**, **external tables**, and integration with execution engines like **Tez** and **Spark** provide users with the flexibility and performance required for large-scale data processing and analytics. These features make Hive a powerful tool for both batch processing and interactive querying of big data in the Hadoop ecosystem.
